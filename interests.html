        <h2>Coding</h2>
        <img src="images/code_screen.jpg" alt="Code on a screen" />
        <p>
          Coding has always interested me! I've read many blogs and articles
          explaining the joy of seeming like a 'wizard' to friends and family.
          I've dabbled in it with small passion projects or small code courses.
          But doing a proper course now I know I enjoy it as much as I enjoyed
          the idea of it.

        <h2>Golf</h2>
        <img src="images/golf.jpg" alt="A golf ball near a hole" />
        <p>
          I've only recently started playing golf, my brother randomly said he
          was going to start playing and I just said i'd give it a go. I'm still
          new and i'm not any good but it seems the enjoyment of golf is the
          learning a skill rather than being good at a skill.

        <h2>Tabletop Role-playing Games</h2>
        <img src="images/ttrpg.JPG" alt="A few TTRPG books covered in dice" />
        <p>
          A hobby I never expected to be so into and I only got into during the
          pandemic. I've suddenly found myself swamped in TTRPG books with the
          aim of get every high praised campaign and running them. Turns out
          there are a fair few critically acclaimed campaigns but I'm keen to
          get them going.

        <h2>Movies</h2>
        <img src="images/movies.jpg" alt="Popcorn and film reel" />
        <p>
          Movies have always been in my life. I wish I had more time for them
          now, but I try to keep my taste sharp but my brows mid-tier as I find
          some critically acclaimed movies to be a bit of a wank on contemporary
          culture and themes. I find myself watching older movies nowadays that
          I watched growing up that deliver a lot of nostalgia.

        <h2>Warhammer 40k</h2>
        <img src="images/tank.jpg" alt="A tank model from warhammer 40k" />
        <p>
          Something I have always seen as 'cool'; 40k is a great hobby which
          teaches patience and also some arts and crafts skills generally how to
          blend and painting tricks I never knew i'd ever know about. I have yet
          to get into any battles but in time i'm sure my day will come. very
          satisfying hobby as the builds can be hard or tedious, but seeing the
          finished product is a beautiful thing!
