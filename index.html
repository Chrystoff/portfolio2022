      <h1>Hi! I'm Brian Macreadie</h1>

    <main>
      <p>
        My name is Brian Macreadie, I am a human man from Launceston, Tasmania.
        I was born on 11th of march 1990 which makes me 32! I have 3 brothers
        and 1 sister. I've worked in multiple industries including hospitality,
        factory labourer, a representative and even a delivery driver.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm undergoing a course to change career path into web development,
        which is exciting as i've always held an interest in coding, computers
        and technology. I have a fiance who is from the United States of
        America, I met her 3 years ago. We had been kept apart because of the
        Australian border closure for 2 years but I recently got to go see her
        when Australia opened up travel in december.
        <br />
        <br />
        My spare time is taken up with time with friends and playing boardgames
        with my siblings. I try to read a lot but It's hard to find time, I
        spend a bit of time driving because of my job so i've recently taken up
        audiobooks to do my reading and i'm able to smash books relatively
        quickly because of it.
