      <p>
        My name is <strong>Brian Macreadie</strong>, I am a <em>human</em> man
        from
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston,_Tasmania"
          target="_blank"
          >Launceston</a
        >,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania" target="_blank"
          >Tasmania</a
        >. I was born on 11th of march 1990 which makes me 32! I have 3 brothers
        and 1 sister. I've worked in multiple industries including hospitality,
        factory labourer, a representative and even a delivery driver.
        <br />
        <br />
        I've studied at university a few times never making it past a year.
        First attempt was business with a major in management you can guess why
        I left that. It was very dry. second attempt was programming but I had
        to do intro courses to lead into the main course which when completed I
        went travelling and took some years working in hospitality before
        attempting programming again this past year and having a good time with
        it for a year but I had a lot of issues with the course deliver. That's
        when a friend told me about coding bootcamps and the success they had
        with it. It was as good a reason as any to try it out! So I did.
        <br />
        <br />
        I've always held an interest in coding, computers and technology. I have
        a fiance who is from the United States of America, I met her 3 years
        ago. We had been kept apart because of the Australian border closure for
        2 years but I recently got to go see her when Australia opened up travel
        in december.
        <br />
        <br />
        My spare time is taken up with time with friends and playing boardgames
        with my siblings. I try to read a lot but It's hard to find time, I
        spend a bit of time driving because of my job so i've recently taken up
        audiobooks to do my reading and i'm able to smash books relatively
        quickly because of it.
